She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise
Think about it
